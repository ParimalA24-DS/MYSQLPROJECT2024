# üìä2.MYSQLPROJECT: Walmart Sales Analysis

![Walmart Sales](https://github.com/ParimalA24-DS/MYSQLPROJECT2024/blob/main/2.MySQL-Walmart-Sales-Analysis/WALMART2.gif)

## üõí Project Overview

This project aims to explore the Walmart Sales data to understand top-performing branches and products, sales trends of different products, and customer behavior. The goal is to study how sales strategies can be improved and optimized. The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.

> "In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact." - Kaggle

## üéØ Purposes Of The Project

The primary aim of this project is to gain insight into Walmart's sales data to understand the different factors affecting sales across various branches.

## üìä About The Data

The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition. This dataset contains sales transactions from three different branches of Walmart, respectively located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. The data contains 17 columns and 1000 rows:

- What is the total revenue by month?
- What month had the largest COGS?
- What product line had the largest revenue?
- Which city has the largest revenue?

**Revenue And Profit Calculations**
- COGS = unit_price * quantity
- VAT = 5% * COGS
- Total = VAT + COGS
- Gross Profit = Total - COGS
- Gross Margin = Gross Income / Total Revenue

### Example Calculation:
- Unit Price = 45.79
- Quantity = 7
- COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53
- VAT = 5% * 320.53 = 16.0265
- Total = 320.53 + 16.0265 = 336.5565
- Gross Margin = 16.0265 / 336.5565 ‚âà 4.76%

### Explanation of Terms and Data Types

2. **gross_margin_pct (Gross Margin Percentage)**:
   - **Description**: The percentage of sales revenue left after covering the cost of goods sold. It shows profitability.
   - **Data Type**: `FLOAT(11,9)`
     - **FLOAT**: Used for approximate numbers, good for measurements.
     - **11,9**: Up to 11 digits with 9 decimal places (e.g., `12.345678901`).

3. **gross_income (Gross Income)**:
